Add option to choose multiple languages (easy on tesseract level, slightly tricky on GUI level)

Write to PDF as we go along, so memory requirements are reduced. Would require further modifying fpdf: https://github.com/jung-kurt/gofpdf/issues/110

Maybe pay apple $100 for a certificate to avoid their security warnings (can be easily included in 'fyne package')

Add more tests.

Improve progress bar by finding how many files will be ocred and counting the number done to provide an accurate count

Maybe parse CropBox from PDF as we do rotate, to crop images appropriately

Add to "microsoft store"
