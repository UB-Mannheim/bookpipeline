# rescribe.xyz/bookpipeline package

This package contains various tools and functions for the OCR of
books, with a focus on distributed OCR using short-lived virtual
servers.

This is a Go package, and can be installed in the standard go way,
by running `go get rescribe.xyz/bookpipeline/...` and documentation
can be read with the `go doc` command or online at
<https://pkg.go.dev/rescribe.xyz/bookpipeline>.

If you just want to install and use the commands, you can get the
package with `git clone https://git.rescribe.xyz/bookpipeline`, and
then install them with `go install ./...` from within the
`bookpipeline` directory.

## Commands

The commands in the cmd/ directory are at the heart of this
package. For more details on their usage, use `go doc` or read
doc.go in the package repository.

The key commands for the virtual server side are:

  - bookpipeline    : processes items from queues, doing preprocessing,
                      ocr and postprocessing, and moving items on to
                      the next queue step on completion. this is the
                      core command of the package.
  - booktopipeline  : uploads a book to the pipeline and adds it to the
                      appropriate queue.
  - getpipelinebook : downloads the pipeline results for a book.
  - lspipeline      : prints useful information about the status of the
                      pipeline.
  - mkpipeline      : sets up storage buckets and queues for use by the
                      pipeline.
  - spotme          : starts up a short-lived virtual server running
                      bookpipeline.

There are also some commands which are more useful in a standalone
setting:

  - confgraph : creates a graph showing average word confidence of
                each page of hOCR in a directory
  - pagegraph : creates a graph showing average confidence of each
                word in a page of hOCR
  - pdfbook   : creates a searchable PDF from a directory of hOCR
                and image files

## Rescribe tool for local operation

While bookpipeline was built with cloud based operation in mind, there is also
a local mode that can be used to run OCR jobs from a single computer, with all
the benefits of preprocessing, choosing the best threshold for each image,
graph creation, PDF creation, and so on that the pipeline provides.

Several of the commands accept a `-c local` flag for local operation, but now
there is also a new command, named `rescribe`, that is designed to make things
much simpler for people just wanting to do some OCR on their local computer.
